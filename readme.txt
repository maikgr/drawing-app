Requirements:
- Windows 7/8/8.1/10 x64/x86

Instructions:
- Extract the .zip file into desired location.
- Navigate to either "win-x64" or "win-x86" folder depending on your operation system.
- Run "Drawing.exe".

Assumptions:
1. When user selected a line coordinate for Bucket tool, the line and any other lines that's connected to the line will be treated as fill area.
2. When user use color 'x' on an area separated by a line/rectangle, the filled area will be treated the same as lines (related to assumption 1).
3. User can only use one letter as bucket's fill color. This is to keep the canvas rendered graphic neat.
4. Given the right coordinates, Rectangle command can also be used to create line.
5. Design-wise, it's assumed that the application extensibility would be towards adding more commands to the application.
